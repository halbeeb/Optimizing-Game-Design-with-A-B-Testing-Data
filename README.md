## **📌 Project Overview**

In the dynamic world of **game development**, balancing **player engagement** with **monetization** is a critical challenge. Over-monetizing risks alienating players, while focusing solely on engagement may fail to generate revenue.  

This project explores how **A/B testing** was used to optimize a specific **in-game mechanic** for:
- 📈 Boosting **player engagement**.
- 💰 Enhancing **monetization opportunities** without disrupting gameplay.  

We analyzed the impact of **new game mechanics** by comparing **control** and **test groups** with robust statistical methods, offering actionable insights to developers and stakeholders.

## **📊 Metrics and Methodology**

### **Key Metrics**  
1. **Engagement Score**  
   Reflects player involvement based on:
   - Number of sessions.
   - Time spent in-game.
   - Actions per session.  

   **Formula**:
   Engagement Score = (Sessions + Time Spent + Actions Per Session) / 3

   
2. **Monetization Score** *(Primary Metric)*  
Measures player revenue contribution via:
- Number of purchases.
- Average purchase value.  

**Formula**:  
Monetization Score = (Purchases × Average Purchase Value) / 10


### **Methodology**  
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
- **Primary Hypothesis**: New mechanics will increase monetization.
- **Secondary Hypothesis**: New mechanics will enhance engagement.  
- **Power Analysis**: Ensured statistical robustness with effect size and sample size calculations.  
- **Experiment Design**:
- **Control Group**: Current mechanics.
- **Test Group**: Enhanced mechanics designed to increase engagement and spending.

### **🔍 Key Insights and Findings**

#### **Monetization Score** *(Primary Metric)*  
- **Control Mean**: 1.98  
- **Test Mean**: 2.31  
- **Improvement**: Significant (Z-Score: 4.60, p-value: 0.000002)

#### **Engagement Score** *(Secondary Metric)*  
- **Control Mean**: 46.65  
- **Test Mean**: 48.79  
- **Improvement**: Significant (Z-Score: 39.92, p-value: 0.000000)

### **Takeaway**:  
The new mechanics significantly improved both engagement and monetization metrics, confirming their effectiveness in creating a more engaging and profitable game experience.
